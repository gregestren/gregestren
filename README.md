I'm a staff software engineer at Google. I've been a core [Bazel](https://www.bazel.build/) developer since 2010.

I [tech lead](https://www.patkua.com/blog/the-definition-of-a-tech-lead/) Bazel's *extensibility and configuration* efforts. We're an 11-person team that focuses on fast, efficient multi-platform builds and tests and APIs that let companies, open-source projects, and programming languages model their particular build workflows.

[Our users](https://bazel.build/community/users) include Lyft, SpaceX, Nvidia, Stripe, Spotify, self-driving vehicle companies, financial companies, and of course Google. Also language maintainers like [Apple](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_apple), [Android](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_android), [Java](https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_java), [Python](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_python), and [Go](https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules_go).

I wrote [this summary](https://blog.bazel.build/2019/02/11/configurable-builds-part-1.html) in 2019 and contributed to [this post](https://blog.bazel.build/2024/08/08/bazel-for-embedded.html) announcing the [Pigweed embedded SDK](https://pigweed.dev/)'s Bazel collaboration with Raspberry Pi. Also see [this review](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditEng/comments/1onkfoa/leveraging_bazel_multiplatform_rbe_for_reddits/) by Reddit's iOS team on using platforms for fast, low-cost builds and tests.

I believe Bazel remains a clear leader in a new generation of build tools and there remains great opportunity to unlock more capabilities that can qualitatively improve software engineering.

I gave a highly regarded [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVx59XOZtSA) on the history of [111 Eighth Ave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/111_Eighth_Avenue) in 2016 based on extensive primary research.
